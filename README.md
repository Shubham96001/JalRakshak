# JalRakshak - Smart Decentralized Water Pollution Management
##Team name: Code Cadets
##Event: INDIA-ISRAEL Hackathon & Symposium
##Theme: Circular Economy - Water Challenge

Problem Statement: Water Pollution - Real Time Monitoring and Decentralised Wastewater treatment
Challenges:
1. Pollution is detected too late
2. No real-time visibilty of water quality
3. Wastewater treatment is highly centralized
4. 72% untreated sewage enters rivers in India

Proposed Solution: JalRakshak is our team's proposed solution which is an AI-Powered, sensor-based, decentralized water monitoring and treatment platform that integrated real-time data, predictive analytics and focusing on community participation rather than individual participation.

Problem --> Solution --> Impact
1. Late pollution detection --> Real time AI and IoT Monitoring --> Prevents river contamination
2. Centralized Treatment --> Modified DEWATS and Local reuse --> Cuts water bills up to 50%
3. Lack of Public Engagement --> Community reporting and incentives --> Creates Water Stewards

Key Features
Real Time Monitoring: Through IoT sensors(pH, Turbidity, Temperature, DO, TDS) connecting through EdgeAI using ESP32 / RaspeberryPI for Instant Alerts and Pollution heatmaps.
Digital Twin: It is a kind of virtual Replica of local water bodies which could simulates the pollution spread and treatment impact and enables proactive infrastructure planning.
AI-Powered Prediction: Predictive analysis is required for focus on forecast of future pollution hotspots.
Water Currency: Digital Credits for verified pollution reduction and Incentivized conservation and responsible usage.
Community-driven Approach: Community can vote on water infrastructure abd can easily report polluted areas via mobile app or offline eporting and with this system can avoid false alerts via integrating AI Sensort and Community approach.
